### Selling point
Gods game will offer a unique twist on the roguelike and in most cases survival genre where death is not something you gloss over, this is the games biggest selling point as it ensures a dopamine inducing experience while playing it. Gods game offers a special system where the player will have a base of operations, from here the player can gear up for a run into the ‘unknown’ – in the unknown the player will have to scavenge for supplies to aid them in an procedually generated world to survive drawing their own map of the mysterious land.. who knows what horrors this world holds.

## Product design
### Player experience
The player will be playing as themselves. What differs from real life is that the player will be constantly gambling their life in gods game. I want the player to feel anxious, terrified, excited and accomplisment all at the same time, like going all in og black in roulette. What keeps the player coming back will be the dopamine, where else can you get the thrill of gambling 100+ hours of your life building your character?

### Setting
The setting of the game will friendly and welcoming close to the base, but the further you wander into the unknown the more dark and gloomy area will become. the world was created by god to see if you’re worthy of his gift before being born earth.

## System design
### Core gameplay and gameplay loops
When going on a run the player will encounter materials and enemies with items that can progess the players strength and gain unique abilities. This in turn might give the player confidence to travel deeper into gods game, where even more crazy things lie in wait.
