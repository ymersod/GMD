### Audience
The target audience is people that want to challenge themselves in a truly thrilling experience. Using the bartle model the primary audience is for achievers and killers. It might also attract some **exploreres**. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bartle_taxonomy_of_player_types
### Selling point
Gods game will offer a unique twist on the roguelike and in most cases survival genre where death is not something you gloss over, this is the games biggest selling point as it ensures a dopamine inducing experience while playing it. Gods game offers a special system where the player will have a base of operations, from here the player can gear up for a run into the ‘wilds’ – in the wilds the player will have to scavenge for supplies to aid them in an unknown procedually generated world to survive drawing their own map of the mysterious land.. who knows what horrors this world holds.

## Product design
The player will be playing as themselves. What differs from real life is that the player will be constantly gambling their life in gods game. I want the player to feel anxious, terrified, excited and accomplisment all at the same time, like going all in og black in roulette. What keeps the player coming back will be the dopamine, where else can you get the thrill of gambling 100+ hours of your life building your character?
The setting of the game will be cute and friendly close to the base, but the further you go wander into the wilds the more dark and gloomy area will become. The world was created by god to see if you’re worthy of his gift before being born earth.
You will be set in a small totorial starting as a boy growing up with his father – but at some point some dark forces drags him away and you’re left to fend for yourself.
The game will sell for a one time fee of  2$-10$.
The game will be topdown 2D for PC and will act as a demo of the core systems and gameplay of the game.

Detailed & Game systems design
When going on a run the player will encounter materials and enemies with items that can progess the players strength and gain unique abilities. This in turn might give the player confidence to travel deeper into gods game, where even more crazy things lie in wait. Exploring the unknown is always a thrilling experience, but with your life on the line that feeling should be x10. Thriving and progressing in such a rough setting should make the player feel a great sense of accomplishment that will drive them forward.
The player will be able to move in 8 directions, the end will be reachin god so he can bestow his gift on you (although the game is supposed to be infinite).
The bigger cogwheels of the games system to make it function would be
•	Procedurelly genereted world
•	AI enemies
•	Crafting system
•	VERY customizable ability/weapon system
The feel of the game should be like the saying ‘fortune favors the bold’, only by challenging themselves and risking it all will the player get what they desire.
The combat will be incorporating elements of LoL(telegraphed attacks, indicators), Noita(customization of equipment), realm of the mad god(moment-to-moment gameplay, combat style, generel look).
