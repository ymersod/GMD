1. ROLL A BALL(er)
This is a game about rolling a lil ball
I thought the PlayerInput component was cool - i had not heard of that one before. Learning a bit about how to make pretty colors was nice. Using the F key to target different GameObjects was a nice hotkey to learn about since it helps traversing the scene view much easier.
I didn't put to much effort into making it cool, just you wait for the next one ;)
